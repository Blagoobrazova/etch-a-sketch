## Overview

### The assignment

- Create a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs;  
- The grid divs change color when your mouse passes over them (or clicks on them), leaving a (pixelated) trail through the grid like a pen would;  
- Ask the user for the number of squares per side for the new grid. Once entered, the existing grid should be removed and a new grid should be generated in the same total space as before;  
- (Optional): Instead of just changing the color of a square from black to white (for example), have each pass through with the mouse change it to a completely random RGB value.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

How to use CSS grid, how to generate a random color, also how to add color picker and music. Practiced manipulating DOM (which is still a new concept to me) and writing functions.

### Continued development

Since this is the first time I've used CSS grid, I need to practice more on that. The way I write functions could use some improvement too, I think they could've been clearer/shorter.

### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell - "Learn CSS grid the easy way"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rg7Fvvl3taU) - This helped me to understand what CSS grid capable of and how I could benefit from it. I highly recommend it to anyone struggling with grid.
- [MDN: input type="color"](https://developer.mozilla.org/ru/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Input/color) - Thanks to this I've added the color pickers.
- [MDN: event.target](https://developer.mozilla.org/ru/docs/Web/API/Event/target) - Helped me when I tried to make a function for drawing.
